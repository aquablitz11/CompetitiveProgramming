/**
 * Timus - 1223. Chernobylâ€™ Eagle on a Roof
 * 
 * Let dp[n][k] denotes the minimum number of experiments you need to conduct if
 * there are n+1 possible answers (0, 1, 2, ..., n) and you only have k eggs.
 * To minimize the number of tests for worst case, use the following recurrence:
 * dp[n][k] = min(max{dp[i-1][k-1], dp[n-i][k]}, 1 <= i <= n)
 * However, total time complexity would be O(N^3). It wouldn't be fast enough for this problem.
 *
 * Notice that the term max{dp[i-1][k-1], dp[n-i][k]} for 1 <= i <= n will be descending,
 * then ascending after a certain index. If the values were distinct for all i, you could use ternary search.
 * However, since the values aren't distinct, ternary search won't work properly. To fix this,
 * when values are the same, you have to look at which index of dp the value came from, which would be distinct.
